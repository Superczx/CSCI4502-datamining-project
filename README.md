# CSCI4502-datamining-project: U.S. Pollution Dataset Analysis
Project Title: US Pollution Dataset Analysis.</br>

Team Members: Peng Yan, Zhixing Chang, Tianlun Zhao, Xiaoyang Dou </br>

Description of the project:</br>

With rapid economic development, people start to pay more attention to health issues. Our team is very interested in environmental pollution. This dataset deals with pollution in the U.S. Pollution in the U.S. has been well documented by the U.S. This data include a total of 28 fields, four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone) for every day from 2000 - 2016. </br>

Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers:</br>
1. What is the main source that cause air pollution in the U.S.?</br>
Answer: NO2
2. What are the main pollutants in the U.S.?</br>
Answer: Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2), Sulphur Dioxide(SO2), Carbon Monoxide(CO) and Ozone(O3).
2. Does the overall level of environmental pollution in the United States show an upward trend or a downward trend?</br>
Answer: Downward trend.
3. Colorado compares to other developed states(New York, Florida, and California), the pollution is more serious or lighter?</br>
Answer: According to the plot of main pollutants AQI(air quality index), we discovered Colorado has more serious pollution than other developed states(New York, Florida, and California).
4. What causes the increase or decrease of pollutantsï¼Ÿ</br>
Answer: There are some aspects for pollutants increasing, burning of fossil fuels, agricultural activities,exhaust from factories and industries, mining operations, indoor air pollution, and population growth.</br>
5. How to solve air pollution?</br>
We can control air pollution through the following methods, Use public mode of transportation, Conserve energy, Understand the concept of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, Emphasis on clean energy resources, Use energy efficient devices. 


Application of this knowledge:</br>

Through our team's plot and analysis, people will be aware of the seriousness of environmental pollution and its impact on people's lives. In addition, People will pay attention to control the main pollutants(CO, SO2, O3, NO2) and call on the government and people to work out an effective plan to reduce main pollutants. </br>
1. We did on AQI of different pollutant from different states help us with future air condition detection.</br>
2. We can make good use of regions and cities with high O3 AQI values to achieve O3 reuse, turning pollutants into important resources for improving environmental pollution.</br>
3. Our data analysis could help people plan activities and routes around current air quality conditions.
